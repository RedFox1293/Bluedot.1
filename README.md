# Bluedot.1
This is Bluedot.1. The revamped skyblock hacked client.
The first part of this was called Danker's Skyblock Mod, made by Danker.
Later, Hael revamped it to create the Hael9 hacked client, with automatic terminal and enchanting solvers, a hyperion macro, a bonemerang macro, and a ghost block macro.
After that, I changed the Hyperion bind to a Mage weapon bind (All wither blades, spirit sceptre, midas staff), an Axe of the Shredded to Valkyrie swap macro, a Rogue Sword speed macro, a katana macro, a soul whip macro, and a Jerry-Chine Gun bind.
Credit to Danker/bowser0000 for the initial DSM, hael for the original hacked client, and ThunderW0lf for the de-obfuscation.
Extra shoutout to hael for helping me out with some of the code when I got stuck, and to Offset for helping me with the half a million errors I got.
Finally, a shoutout to all my friends who looked over my code and tested it for me, you guys rock.
